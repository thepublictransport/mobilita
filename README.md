# Project Mobilita

Multimodal Search, Cross-Platform, Modern, Revolutionary

## Info

Mobilita is kind of from italian which means "mobility".
This won't replace "The Public Transport" at all. Both projects will be continued. TPT is like our swiss army knife for traveling. 

The approach of Mobilita is kinda different.

## Approach

We have enough of these divided paths of mobility. We want to unite all the data we can get, and provide it on mobile, web and desktop with the power of Flutter !

## What will happen ?

We are starting now the development of Mobilita. 

Things we target on:

- Keeping one codebase for every dimension
- Multimodal search of trips
- Get your best and cheapest was from A to B
- Using The Public Transport APIs and Services
- Creating Mobilita Service for everyone to use

If we think our codebase is ready, we will release anything to the public.

## Platform Support

We target to support these platforms:

- Android
- iOS
- Web
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

## License

We will use GPL 3.0 for this project. This should be and still keep free software, at least in many parts as possible and GPL will help us with that!
